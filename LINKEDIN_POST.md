## Version 1: Achievement-Focused

🚀 **I built a documentation system that never drifts – in 2 months, no CS degree.**

80% of documentation is outdated. Developers change code, but not docs. Code reviews don't catch it. CI doesn't check it.

So I built **Noyrax** – an AI-native documentation system that automatically generates, validates, and maintains documentation.

**What it does:**
✅ Automatically generates Markdown docs from code
✅ Detects when documentation drifts from code
✅ Validates documentation in CI/CD pipelines
✅ Provides structured access for AI agents (Cursor, Copilot)

**The numbers:**
📊 71 modules automatically documented
🗺️ 99 MCP-Server resources for AI-agent navigation
📝 27 Architecture Decision Records
🔍 5-dimensional navigation space for AI agents

**Built with:**
- TypeScript
- VS Code Extension API
- MCP-Server (Model Context Protocol)
- Reality-Driven Development principles

**Key innovation:** A 5-dimensional coordinate system that lets AI agents navigate codebases like a map:
- Module Space (X): API documentation per file
- Symbol Space (Y): Symbols with dependencies
- Relationship Space (Z): Module dependencies
- Knowledge Space (W): Architecture Decision Records
- Time Space (T): Changes over time

## Version 2: Problem-Solution-Focused

**80% of documentation is outdated. I built a solution.**

The problem: Developers change code, but not docs. Code reviews don't catch it. CI doesn't check it. Onboarding takes weeks. Bugs happen because of outdated information.

The solution: **Noyrax** – an AI-native documentation system that automatically generates, validates, and maintains documentation.

**Built in 2 months. No CS degree. Open source.**

**What makes it different:**
🧠 **Semantic Intelligence** – Role-based documentation depth
🗺️ **Multi-Dimensional Navigation** – 5 dimensions for AI agents
✅ **Reality-Driven Development** – Verification loops prevent hallucinations
🔗 **ADR Integration** – Architecture decisions automatically linked to code

**The impact:**
- Documentation stays in sync automatically
- CI/CD blocks merges if docs are outdated
- AI agents can navigate codebase intelligently
- Faster onboarding for new team members

## Version 3: Story-Focused

**I spent 2 months building a documentation system. Here's what I learned.**

The problem: Documentation is always outdated. Developers hate writing it. It gets stale immediately. Code reviews don't catch it.

So I built **Noyrax** – an AI-native system that automatically generates, validates, and maintains documentation.

**The journey:**
- Started with a simple idea: "What if docs could never drift?"
- Built a VS Code Extension in TypeScript
- Added MCP-Server integration for AI agents
- Created a 5-dimensional navigation space
- Documented every decision (27 ADRs)

**The result:**
✅ 71 modules automatically documented
✅ 99 MCP-Server resources for AI navigation
✅ CI/CD integration for drift detection
✅ Open source, MIT License

**Key innovation:** A coordinate system with 5 dimensions that lets AI agents navigate codebases like a map. Think of it as GPS for code.

Built in public. Every decision documented. Open source.
